In this <a href="https://github.com/michael-hartmann/Casimir/blob/master/thesis.pdf?raw=true">master thesis</a>, we study the Casimir effect in the plane&ndash;sphere
geometry, in particular with respect to the effect of negative entropies. We
show that the Maxwell equations in vacuum are equivalent to the source-free
vector Helmholtz equation and introduce the plane wave basis and the multipole
basis as solutions. Moreover, we present the solutions to the scattering
problems of electromagnetic waves at a planar, homogenous interface and at a
sphere, where the metallic properties of plane and sphere are either described
by the Drude model, the plasma model or the model of perfect reflectors. With
the Fresnel and Mie coefficients as well as the solutions of the Helmholtz
equation at hand, we apply the scattering approach to the plane&ndash;plane and
to the plane&ndash;sphere geometry. Although equivalent to the matrix elements
of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4294">Durand et al.</a>, our matrix
elements of the scattering matrix in the plane--sphere geometry avoid Wigner
D-matrix elements. After changing to scaled quantities the free energy for
perfect reflectors depends only on temperature and separation. Also, we
considered analytically the contribution to the free energy of the Matsubara
frequency ξ=0, because this special case raises numerical problems. The
software implementation of the formulas reveals several serious numerical
problems, e.g. the problem of computing the determinant of a matrix whose
elements differ by hundreds of orders of magnitude. We discuss these
problems and present solutions for a fast and stable software implementation.</p>

<p>We compare our numerical results with the proximity force approximation
(PFA) that links the unknown free interaction energy of arbitrary geometries to
the well-known energy of the plane&ndash;plane geometry. We show that indeed
the PFA becomes a good approximation in the limit of small separations. As
entropies obtained using the PFA are always positive, we conjecture that the
effect of negative entropies vanishes for small separations. This assumption is
strengthened by the study of the large&ndash;distance limit. We derive an
analytical expression for the free energy in the limit of large separations and
show that the negative entropies are linked with a change of polarization
within a round trip. For low temperatures we show that the entropy as a
function of the separation has a minimum and probably tends to zero for small
separations. As the matrix elements of the scattering matrix become independent
of the particular properties of the material in the high temperature limit, we
study this limit for perfect reflectors as well as for Drude mirrors. We rule
out several suggestions for the free energy at small separations and proof the
validity of an expansion <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5921">Bimonte and
Emig</a>. At last, we show that negative entropies exist over a wide range of
parameters. In accordance with previous assumptions, we find that negative
entropies disappear for small separations. The smaller the separation the lower
is the temperature at which the entropy becomes positive. This means that the
effect of negative entropies is more evident for large separations. In contrast
to this, at the same time the Casimir effect becomes less pronounced for large
separations.</p>
